# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I am completing [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 77% now. Just finished the Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript to be played using prompt feature and results displayed in the console. 

**Thoughts** I am used to C++ so learning different syntax and having to console.log to test is interesting.

### Day 2: May 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I am completing [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 81%% now. Completed Lesson 8: Clean Code and Lesson 9: Installing Node.js. Began Lesson 10: Fundamentals Pt. 4

**Thoughts** Being someone who is OCD and very detail oriented, clean code will be very easy for me. Also started on arrays and loops in JS. Very different than C++ in my opinion
