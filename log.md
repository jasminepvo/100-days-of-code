# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 77%. Just finished the Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript to be played using prompt feature and results displayed in the console. 

**Thoughts** I am used to C++ so learning different syntax and having to console.log to test is interesting.

### Day 2: May 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 81%. Completed Lesson 8: Clean Code, Lesson 9: Installing Node.js. Began Lesson 10: Fundamentals Pt. 4(Arrays)

**Thoughts** Being someone who is OCD and very detail oriented, clean code will be very easy for me. This reminds of my first CS course I ever took where my professor graded the first program extremely hard on indentation, capitalization, syntax etc. and most of the class failed but I got a 100! Also started on arrays and loops in JS. Arrays are easy but loops are different than C++ in my opinion

### Day 3: May 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) at 81%. Completing Lesson 10: Fundamentals Pt. 4(Loops, Test Driven Development, Practice Problem: helloWorld, repeatString, reverseString, removeFromArray).

**Thoughts** Good refresher of for and while loops. I was able to easily code the practice problems on paper and match up to the solution. Thoughts on individual exercises: 
helloWorld - simple test
repeatString - pretty simple for loop
reverseString - although there are other methods, it's cool JavaScript has built in methods to split, reverse and join that make the solution simple. Otherwise would have to use a decrementing for loop or recursion
removeFromArray - learned how rest parameters syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array and then used the filter method to iterate through the array and pass values that return true into a new, filtered array
